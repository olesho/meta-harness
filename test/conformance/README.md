<!-- VENDORED COPY — do not hand-edit. Re-run scripts/sync-conformance.sh. -->

# Vendored here — read this first

This directory is a **vendored, consume-only** copy of harness-wrapper's
`test/conformance/`, pulled by `scripts/sync-conformance.sh`. Only `*.json` and
this README are copied: the canonical tree also holds the Go *generators*
(`conformance_test.go`, `neutral/neutral.go`), which are not corpus data and are
deliberately left behind. `MANIFEST.sha256` is copied verbatim **and** recomputed
locally; the sync fails if the two disagree. `README.md` is hashed by neither
side's manifest, which is why this banner is free to exist.

Regenerating the corpus is harness-wrapper's job (`make regen-conformance`).
Never hand-edit a fixture here — change the Go types, regenerate there, re-sync.

## Which artifact is this? Three, not two

| Artifact | Path | Kind | Consumer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Conformance corpus** (this) | `test/conformance/` | OFFLINE vendored goldens | `test/conformance_corpus.test.ts` |
| **Wire corpus** | `test/corpus/wire/` | OFFLINE vendored goldens | `test/wire_corpus.test.ts` |
| **Live conformance suite** | `test/conformance.test.ts` | GATED LIVE (`CONFORMANCE=1`, real installed binaries) | — |

The top-level [`test/corpus/README.md`](../corpus/README.md) already draws the
first line of that taxonomy — the vendored wire goldens are an offline check,
distinct from the gated live suite. The same line runs through this directory,
and the collision is sharper here: this corpus and `test/conformance.test.ts`
are told apart by a file extension. [`test/corpus/wire/README.md`](../corpus/wire/README.md)
states the general trap in one line — *"The wire corpus" ≠ "the conformance
suite."* — and the extra row above is its sequel: the conformance **corpus** is
not the conformance **suite** either.

*The canonical harness-wrapper README follows, verbatim.*

# Cross-language conformance corpus

Language-neutral, frozen JSON contracts shared between **harness-wrapper**
(canonical Go side, this repo) and **meta-harness** (TypeScript consumer). This
is the ONE shared artifact both languages diff their own serialization against,
so a contract that drifts on one side fails loudly on the other.

This is **not** `test/corpus/` — that is the PTY byte-stream bake-off corpus with
its own `<harness>/<scenario>/bytes.raw` layout and `make rebake-corpus`
lifecycle. These conformance goldens are frozen wire contracts with a different
lifecycle, so they live under this sibling root.

## Ownership: one authority, not two

`pkg/turnproto/protocol.go` declares the Go types the ONE source of truth
(meta-harness design §7). This corpus is **derived from** those Go types, never
the reverse. **Only harness-wrapper regenerates it**, via `make regen-conformance`
(the `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` convention made executable as an ordered two-step);
**meta-harness only consumes.** An intentional contract change therefore has a
defined home: change the Go types, `make regen-conformance`, sync outward.

## Layout

```
gateway/      chatd wire DTOs (cmd/harness-chatd package-main types)
  fields.json     neutral field contract for every wireTypes() DTO
  <DTO>.<case>.json   example instances (turnDTO, inputRequestDTO, answerRequest,
                      openRequest, conversationSummary, errorResponse)
turnresult/   StructuredTurnResult (pkg/turnproto) + embedded transcript.Event / Usage
  fields.json     neutral field contract
  StructuredTurnResult.<case>.json   example instances per TurnStatus + optional variants
cli/          exit-code table + deadline anchor
  exit_codes.json    ExitOK/ExitError/ExitUsage/ExitDeadline + deadline_line
  emit_pairing.json  status -> {exit_code, stderr_anchor} behavior table
MANIFEST.sha256   sha256 of every corpus .json file (integrity guard)
```

## Neutral type vocabulary

`fields.json` describes each DTO as an ordered list of
`{name, json_tag, type, optional}`, where `type` is one of:

| neutral    | Go source                                            |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `string`   | `string`                                             |
| `int`      | any integer / float kind                             |
| `bool`     | `bool`                                                |
| `array`    | slice / array (except `[]byte`)                      |
| `object`   | map / anonymous inline struct                        |
| `ref`      | a named nested DTO struct (e.g. `inputOptionDTO`)    |
| `any`      | `json.RawMessage` / `[]byte` / `interface{}` — an arbitrary JSON value (e.g. `transcript.Event.ToolInput`) |
| `timestamp`| `time.Time`, serialized as an RFC3339 string (e.g. `transcript.Event.Timestamp`) |

`optional` is a **single boolean** collapsing all THREE Go-side optionality
sources — a pointer type (`*chat.InputPolicy`), an `omitempty` tag, **or an
`omitzero` tag** (`turnDTO.CompletedAt`). TypeScript cannot see any of these
distinctions, so `fields.json` does not expose them. Fields tagged `json:"-"`
(e.g. `transcript.Event.SchemaVersion` / `Source` / `NativeID`) are internal
store metadata and are excluded — the corpus pins the **public** JSON form.

## Comparison semantics: structural, NOT byte-identity

Go's `encoding/json` emits struct-field order; TS `JSON.stringify` emits
insertion order — so **byte identity is explicitly not required**. Each side
**parses** the golden JSON and compares structurally (key set, types, values,
presence/absence of optionals) against its own serialization; neither side
string-compares its output to the golden bytes.

The golden files themselves are generated **once** by the Go generators, so they
have a stable canonical byte form (needed for the manifest hash — see
Determinism). Consumers treat them as parse targets.

## Determinism

The generators emit `fields.json` with **sorted DTO names** and
**struct-declaration field order**, pretty-printed with a two-space indent and a
trailing newline. Regenerated bytes are reproducible, so the manifest hash is
stable across regenerations that changed nothing.

## MANIFEST.sha256

sha256 of every corpus `.json` file, `sha256sum`-style, sorted by relative path.
It guards **corpus-file integrity only** — it detects an unsynced or tampered
vendored copy. It is **NOT** a cross-language byte-identity claim (see Comparison
semantics). meta-harness recomputes the same hash over its vendored copy;
`scripts/check-conformance-corpus.sh` compares the two.

## Regeneration

`make regen-conformance` is the **only** supported entry point. It is an ordered
two-step because `gateway/` is emitted by the chatd-hosted test while the manifest
is emitted by the external package over the *whole* corpus:

```
UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 go test ./cmd/harness-chatd/   # writes gateway/
UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 go test ./test/conformance/    # writes turnresult/ + cli/, then MANIFEST.sha256
```

A plain `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 go test ./...` does **not** guarantee cross-package
order and can write a manifest over stale gateway bytes — always use the target.

## Layering: this corpus adds a cross-language copy, it does not duplicate

The `cli/` pins and the optional-key present/absent tests **layer on**, and do
not replace, the existing in-repo pins:

- `pkg/turnproto/turnproto_test.go` already asserts the exit-code constants,
  `DeadlineLine`, and optional-key marshaling.
- `pkg/env/turn.go` (`RunStructuredTurn`) documents the host-side exit-code
  table, and `cmd/harness-wrapper/structured_run.go` performs the guest emit.
  Both delegate to the ONE canonical `turnproto.ExitCode`; `emit_pairing.json`
  is asserted against that function so the cross-language copy cannot drift.
- The `completed -> 0` row is already pinned end-to-end by
  `TestStructuredRun_GoldenCompleted` and `pkg/env/turn_test.go`. The corpus's
  new guest-emit coverage is `deadline -> 124` **with `DeadlineLine` on stderr**,
  `errored -> 1`, and `startup_error -> 1`
  (`cmd/harness-wrapper/conformance_test.go`).

## Behavior rows (not DTO shapes)

Some contracts are HTTP/CLI *behavior*, represented by a fixture plus a row here:

| condition | result | fixture |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `option_ids` on a non-`multi_select` prompt | HTTP **400** | `gateway/errorResponse.not_multi_select.json` |
| turn status `deadline` | exit **124** + `DeadlineLine` on stderr | `cli/emit_pairing.json` |
| invalid `permission_mode` (or `effort`) | HTTP **400** | `gateway/errorResponse.invalid_config.json` |

The HTTP status itself is asserted by chatd's own handler tests (HARNESS-WRAPPER-49),
not by the corpus round-trip.

## Scope

- **`clients/` is not yet covered.** `clients/typescript` and `clients/python`
  speak the same gateway DTOs but have no test scaffolding today. A follow-up
  ticket — *"SDK conformance: bootstrap `clients/` test scaffolding and consume
  `test/conformance/gateway/` fixtures"* — is filed at ship time.
- The durable store-only transcript wire form (`pkg/transcript/event_wire.go`)
  is a separate serialization and out of scope; this corpus pins the **public**
  `StructuredTurnResult` JSON form only.
